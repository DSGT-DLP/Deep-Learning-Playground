**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.

**Setup Instructions (what branch to work off of)**
Create branch `<dev-branch-name>` off of `<base-branch>`. `<base-branch>` is either `backend`, `frontend`, `full-stack`

Note: Tasks that are solely frontend should have dev branches created off of `frontend`. Tasks that are solely backend should have dev branches created off of `backend` and tasks that involve both backend and frontend should have dev branches created off of `full-stack`
