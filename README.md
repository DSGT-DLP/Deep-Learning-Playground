# Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Have the following installed first:

1. [Node.js v18 via NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) (Install nvm first, and then install node & npm using nvm)

1. [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mamba-installation.html#mamba-install) (On windows, remember to check the box that says that it will add mamba to path)
1. [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (Is also automatically installed with Python via Python's installer, make sure this version of pip is installed globally)
1. [dlp-cli](https://github.com/DSGT-DLP/dlp-cli#readme) (We have our own cli!)

1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
1. [go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (In case if you ever need to contribute to the dlp-cli)
1. VSCode Extensions:

   1. [Go](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go)

## Clone the Repository

`git clone https://github.com/DSGT-DLP/Deep-Learning-Playground.git` in the directory of your choice. This can also be achieved through GitKraken.

## Frontend and Backend Package Installation

Run the following commands in the project directory (the root folder created after cloning):

| Action                           | Command                    |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Install/Update Frontend Packages | `dlp-cli frontend install` |
| Install/Update Backend Packages  | `dlp-cli backend install`  |

## GitGuardian Pre-commit Check

To install the GitGuardian cli and pre-commit, run

```sh
pip install ggshield
pip install pre-commit
```

To protect our secrets, we use the GitGuardian ggshield pre-commit check to ensure no keys are being committed. After installing the backend, run

```sh
pre-commit install
```

You should get output like "pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit". Login to GitGuardian to activate the pre-commit hook using

```sh
ggshield auth login
```

If this command works properly, you will be redirected to an auth route in the Git Guardian website. **Sign in using your Github account**. Then, you should be all set!

## Additional VSCode Setup (Recommended)

Access the VSCode command palette via `Ctrl+Shift+P`. Press `Python: Select Interpreter`. You need the Python VSCode extension for this.

Select the Python Interpreter named `dlp`.

## To start on localhost (in order):

Run the following commands in the project directory (the root folder created after cloning):

| Action               | Command                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Running the Frontend | `dlp-cli frontend start` |
| Running the Backend  | `dlp-cli backend start`  |
