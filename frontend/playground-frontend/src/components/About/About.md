# Deep Learning Playground
Your destination for training your Deep Learning models.

# About
**Deep Learning** has made advancements recently. People are trying to utilize **Deep
Learning** to build models to solve increasingly complex problems and drive business
impact. Two well known libraries for deep learning are **Pytorch** and **Tensorflow**.
While these open source libraries make deep learning accessible, to use them, one requires prior coding experience. However, we believe that the low code, no code movement is
picking up and we thought that if we want to improve accessibility and empower the average person to play around with deep learning, we should build an online "playground".

Deep Learning Playground allows for the average user to upload a dataset, set hyper-parameters, and drag/drop layers and build a deep learning model without any prior programming knowledge.

TLDR:

* Easy environment to prototype your deep learning models
* No need to write code for deep learning
* Interactive tool to learn about deep learning
* Active development with support and functionality being enhanced by a dedicated, user-focused team of software engineers

# Tech

Deep Learning Playground uses the following tools and libraries to work properly:

* Python : Programming language widely used for Data Science, AI, and ML. Easily
understandable by a human and has a lot of developer support
* Pytorch : Libary that helps build, train, test deep learning models. We use
this library to build the user-defined deep learning model
* pandas : Python library that allows one to parse CSV files and extract relevant
information. It's very user friendly and has helpful documentation
* Flask : Backend service that allows for the modeling magic to happen
* React : JavaScript library used to display the website to the user

# Installation
See the README.md in the [Github Repo](https://github.com/karkir0003/Deep-Learning-Playground) for setup instructions. These setup instructions
are mainly for those developing/enhancing the tool. For the user, simply go to the
"Deep Learning tab" at the top of the page

# User 

As the user, all you need to do in the Deep Learning Playground is upload your dataset
or enter a URL to it (dataset must be in a CSV or ZIP file format). Drag and drop the
layers from the available blocks to the purple "+" icon, select values in the
dropdowns, and click train! Sit back and relax and let us take care of building the
model!
Once the model building has finished, you will get a downloadable image corresponding
to the plots of loss (and accuracy depending on if you do a classification or
regression problem). You will also have access to a CSV corresponding to the
performance stats/metrics of your model!

# Development

Want to contribute? Great! Email one of the collaborators in the Github Repo for more
information on how you can get involved in pushing the impact of Deep Learning
Playground Forward.
If you have any problems with using the tool or have a request for a future feature to the
tool, please post an issue in GitHub by clicking on the "Issues" tab at the top and
selecting "New Issue". The development team will respond to your request ASAP!
